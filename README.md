# Application of Nonparametric Kernel Density Estimation in Colombo Stock Market (S&P SL 20)

## ðŸ“œ Introduction
This project explores the application of nonparametric Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to analyze stock price patterns in the Colombo Stock Market (S&P SL 20). It provides insights into market behavior, identifies hidden patterns in stock returns, and compares nonparametric KDE with classical parametric methods.

## ðŸŽ¯ Research Objectives
- To apply KDE to analyze stock price distributions for the Colombo Stock Market.
- To evaluate the effectiveness of KDE in capturing unique patterns in stock returns.
- To compare the outcomes of classical parametric approaches with nonparametric KDE.

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- The **Epanechnikov kernel** was selected for its efficiency in density estimation.
- An optimal bandwidth of **h = 0.2** was identified using cross-validation.
- KDE provided superior insights compared to traditional parametric methods.
