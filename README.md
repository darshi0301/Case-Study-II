# Application of Nonparametric Kernel Density Estimation in Colombo Stock Market (S&P SL 20)

ðŸ“œ Introduction
This project explores the application of nonparametric Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to analyze stock price patterns in the Colombo Stock Market (S&P SL 20). It provides insights into market behavior, identifies hidden patterns in stock returns, and compares nonparametric KDE with classical parametric methods.

ðŸŽ¯ Research Objectives
To apply KDE to analyze stock price distributions for the Colombo Stock Market.
To evaluate the effectiveness of KDE in capturing unique patterns in stock returns.
To compare the outcomes of classical parametric approaches with nonparametric KDE.
